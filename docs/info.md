## How it works

This design uses flipflops to take one input of true or false, and gives different outputs depending on the current state. 
The state is updated manually with a push button to control the clock

## How to test

have the input true, use button to move all the way "up"
have the input false, use button to move all the way "down"
be on the 2nd floor going "up" and then go "down"
be on the 2nd floor going "down" and then go "up"

## External hardware

3 LEDs, each on indicating a different floor
1 push button to control clock
"up" or "down" switch
